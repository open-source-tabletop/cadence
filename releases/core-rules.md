Introduction: This section should provide an overview of the game and explain what it is about. You might want to include a brief history of the game or the world it is set in, as well as a description of the scale of the game (e.g. skirmish, battalion-level, etc.). This section might also include a table of contents to help players find specific rules more easily.

Cadence System - Core Rules
===========================

Version 0.1

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cadence System, a free, community owned wargaming ruleset designed to open up a world of wargaming possibilities. These core rules provide the foundation upon which any number of games can be created, you will find a range of pre-written modules and expansions to play or you can create your own game using the system.

Section 1 - Basic Rules
=======================

## Dice

Cadence uses six sided dice, written as "d6", to determine the outcome of many actions and there are a few ways these are used. The most common is in an action roll, such as an attack roll to see if a weapon hits an enemy unit. action rolls are always based on a single d6, though you may make many action rolls at the same time, where each dice must score equal to or above a target number to count as a success, with anything below the target being a failure.

Action rolls often have modifiers applied to them making the roll either easier or more difficult. The modifiers may affect the roll to where it would automatically succeed or automatically fail regardless of the value rolled. A roll of a 1 always counts as a failure regardless of modifiers, however a modifier that automatically fails still counts as a failure regardless of the number rolled.

You may also be asked to "roll-off" against other players. In this case both players roll a number of d6 equal to the number of players in the roll-off with the winner being the player with the highest combined result. In the case of a tie players should roll-off again until they have unique results.

Unless otherwise instructed, your dice rolls should be done in full view of all players with enough time for them to see the results. 

Six sided dice are also used in the game to mark a unit's remaining actions and hit points. In this case the dice are not rolled but instead the top face of the dice represents the value. In practice this means you will need at least 3 colours of six sided dice to avoid mixing up these uses on the tabletop.

## Distance and Measuring

Measuring is another key part of the game, whether checking if a unit is in range for an attack, or seeing how far they travel when moving. Cadence uses inches for all distances and you will need a ruler marked in inches to play. When you measure the distance to or from a model you always do so from the closest point on it's base. You may measure any distance at any time so long as doing so does not interfere with the actions of your opponent or unnecessarily slow down the game.

## Armies

In Cadence, each player has a selection of miniatures that represent their army. This can vary depending on the module you choose but will usually include a range of units, such as infantry, vehicles, or monsters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Every model in a player's army is considered friendly, all the models in your opponent's army are considered enemies.

## Units and Models

To avoid confusion there are some terms relating to your miniatures which have specific meaning within the game. While you may find modules using a wide variety of miniatures in many different scales, a **model** is a miniature, or group of miniatures, which are mounted on a single base or are otherwise connected. If a model does not have a base, such as is sometimes the case with large vehicle or monster miniatures, it must have a clear footprint to count as the base within the game.

Units are groupings of 1 or more models within the game. Some modules will group several models together, like soldiers in a squad, others will have each unit contain only a single model. All models must belong to exactly one unit.

### Profiles and Attributes

In order to play a game, you need to know which models you can use and what they can do on the battlefield. Each module will contain relevant unit profiles, often organised into army lists, that give you all the information you need for your units.

A unit profile has the following information:

- The unit's name.
- The unit configuration, explaining which models it includes and which weapons and equipment.
- Model attributes for each model in the unit, some modules may list these separately.
- Special rules that apply to the unit.
- Any abilities the unit has.

### Attributes

Each model in Cadence has a set of attributes that tell you how well it can perform various actions, these are:

- Command (C): The number of actions this model can perform each round.
- Movement (M): The number of inches this model can travel during a move action:
- Skill (S): The model's ability with it's weapons.
- Defence (D): The model's armour or ability to negate attacks.
- Toughness (T): How much damage the model can take for each of it's hit points.
- Hit Points (H): How much damage the model can take before being destroyed.

### Special Rules

Special rules modify how the model operates within the game. Some special rules are universal and are included in this book, these are typically given simply by name in a unit profile. Others are unique to a module, army, or model, and will be provided in the unit's profile or army list.

### Abilities

Abilities are like actions that are unique to a unit. These work like normal actions and the details of how they work, along with any requirements or restrictions, will be given in a unit's profile.

### Unit Formation

Units consisting of more than one model must stay within close proximity of each other during a battle, known as being "in formation". A unit is in formation when the distance between each model forms a chain connecting all the models with a gap between each model no larger than 3 inches. Every time you activate a unit, after you move each of your models, the unit must finish that action in formation.

It is possible for your unit to become out of formation during another units activation, by losing models as they are destroyed for example. If this happens, the next time the unit activates it must immediately make a move action to restore being in formation. If it cannot be resume being in formation after it's move action the unit is destroyed and removed from the game.

## Weapons

In order to fight, your models require weapons and these will be listed in your unit profile. Weapons have their own set of attributes which are usually provided in your module or army list. These are:

- Range (R): The distance the weapon can make an attack up to.
- Attacks (A): The volume or intensity of the attacks from the weapon.
- Damage (D): The damage each successful hit from the weapon inflicts.
- Piercing (P): The weapons ability to negate armour.
- Special Rules that apply to the weapon.
