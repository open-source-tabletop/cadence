Squadrons
=========

Squadrons is a tabletop space combat Game using the Cadence System featuring fighter scale ships.

Section 1 - Rules
=================

This game uses the Cadence Wargame System for it's core rules with the following additional rules.

## Battlefield

Squadrons is best played on either a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area.

## Ships 

Each model in Squadrons represents a single ship of fighter or bomber scale referred to throughout as Ships.

## Ship Movement

Ships in Squadrons are flying at high speeds meaning they need to be carefully manoeuvred.

Each time you activate one of your Ships you must always spend at least 1 Command Point on a Move action, though you may still choose when to perform this action. When you perform this action you must also move the maximum distance allowed in a straight line directly forward. 

- When spending 1 Command Point on a Move action you may make 1 pivot up to 45 degrees at any point during your movement.
- When you spend 2 Command Points you may either move double your Movement distance, making 1 pivot up to 45 degrees, or move your normal Movement distance and make 2 pivots up to 45 degrees.
- Alternatively you may move your normal Movement distance and make a pivot of exactly 180 degrees.

## Assault Range

Ships in Squadrons are permitted to freely move in and out of an enemy model's Assault Range and do not end their activation when leaving an enemy model's Assault Range. Ships with enemy ships in their Assault Range may choose any enemy model as their target when making an attack.

## Moving over Bases

You may move over the bases of any friendly or enemy models during your movement so long as you have sufficient movement to complete the move without the bases overlapping. If you do not have sufficient movement your model stops before passing over the enemy base and your activation ends.

## Evasion

When this model is targeted for an attack it may try to evade the attack if it still has Command Points remaining. Spend one Command Point and move this model up to 2 inches directly to the left or right of its forward direction. This model may re-roll any failed Defence rolls from the attack that targetted it. 

## Line of Sight

Line of sight should be worked out for ships using only their bases, when looking through a model for line of sight the line is drawn from the base not "through the eyes" of the model.

## Terrain

There are two types of terrain available in Squadrons: Obscuring and Dangerous. Models may move freely across this terrain with the following additional rules.

### Obscuring

Models cannot make attacks that pass through Obscuring terrain.

### Dangerous

Models that spend any part of their activation within Dangerous terrain must roll 3 d6, for each roll of a 6 the model takes 3 damage and must make a Defence roll as though it was the target of an attack.

## Special Rules

The following new special rules apply to units and weapons in Squadrons.
