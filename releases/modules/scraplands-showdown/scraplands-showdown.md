Scraplands Showdown
===================

Scraplands Showdown is a vehicular racing and combat game using the Cadence System.

Section 1 - Rules
=================

This game uses the Cadence Wargame System for it's core rules with the following additional rules.

## Battlefield

Scraplands Showdown is best played on either a 3ft x 3ft or similar sized area.

## Cars

The models in Scraplands represent ramshackle vehicles with makeshift weapons and armour. These models should be around the 1:64 scale similar to die cast model cars. These models may be referred to throughout this module as cars.

## Car Arcs

Instead of just a front and rear arc a car also has a left and right side arc. These are defined by the 4 corners of the car: The front arc extends out from the front 2 corners with the sides of this arc extending out at 45 degrees to the forward direction. The rear arc is the same from tbe back cornerstone of the vehicle extending out to the backwards direction. The left and right side arcs are the spaces between the front and back on either side of the car.

## Car Movement

When moving one of your cars they must always move directly forward up to their allowed movement distance. 

- When spending 1 Command Point on a Move action a car is allowed to pivot up to 45 degrees every time it has moved a full 2 inches.
- When spending 1 Command Point you may instead move 2 inches directly backwards, you may make one pivot of up to 45 degrees during the move.
- When spending 2 Command Points you may only pivot up to 45 degrees once during the move.

## Passing and Blocking 

Cars are permitted to move over the base of any friendly or enemy model so long as they have sufficient movement to do so.

If moving over an enemy vehicle that player may attempt to block the car from passing. Both players roll-off and add their model's Skill to the roll. If the player trying to move over the enemy model is successful they finish moving their model as normal. If the player being passed wins the moving model stops it's movement before moving over the enemy car and it's activation ends.
