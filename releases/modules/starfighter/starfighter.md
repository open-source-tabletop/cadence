Starfighter
===========

A Tabletop Space Combat Game using the Cadence System

Section 1 - Rules
=================

This game uses the Cadence Wargame System for it's core rules with the following additional rules.

## Starfighters

Each model in Starfighter represents a single ship of fighter or bomber scale referred to throughout as Ships.

## Ship Movement

Ships in Starfighter are flying at high speeds meaning they need to be carefully manoeuvered. The following additional rules apply to moving your Ships.

### Compulsory Movement

Each time you activate one of your Ships you must always perform at least 1 Command Point of Movement, though you may still choose when to perform this action. When you perform this action you must also move the maximum distance allowed.

### Manoeuvres

When you move a ship it moves it's full allowed distance in a straight line directly forward. At either the start or end of each movement you may pivot the ship up to 45 degrees. If you have spent 2 Command Points on a move action you may instead move up to your Movement attribute and then pivot 180 degrees.

### Assault Range

Your ships Assault Range extends 2 inches instead of 1, however there are no restrictions to moving though the assault range of any enemy models.

### Moving over Bases

You may move over the bases of any friendly or enemy models during your movement so long as you have sufficient movement to complete the move without the bases overlapping. If you do not have sufficient movement your model stops before passing over the enemy base and your activation ends.

### Evasion

When this model is targeted for an attack it may try to evade the attack if it still has Command Points remaining. Spend one Command Point and move this model up to 2 inches directly to the left or right of its forward direction. This model may re-roll any failed Defence rolls from the attack that targetted it. 

## Special Rules

The following new special rules apply to units and weapons in Starfighter.

| Unit Special Rules | Details |
| :----------------- | :------ |
| Agile | This ship may make a second 45 degree turn either at the beginning or end of a Movement action |
| Shields (x) | This ship may make a shield roll for any failed defence rolls it suffers, on a d6 roll of x or higher this counts as a successful defence roll. |
